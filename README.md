==========

This project helps you convert digital Jira Kanban Boards in to Physical Boards, by generating a Machine-Readable tickets to be placed on White-Board.
But what's so special about the project is that it helps you automatically synchronize the Digital Board with one Schoot of the Physical Board, 

It Does the following:
- Scans your Physical Board
- Identifies the status of each ticket based on the colument / area of status it belongs to.
- Discovers your Jira work-flow
- Updates your Jira Ticket to reflect what you see on the board, helping you keep a full-sync between the Physical board and your digital version of it in Jira Systems.
